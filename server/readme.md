# SlackGreet

SlackGreet is a tool designed to aggregate a user's slack messages for ease of use in this world of remote workspace where we communicate by slack.

Adding too much slack workspaces could result in missing out important mentions, reactions, chats in a particular workspace as recieving message/chat/notifiction badges is limited to a certain number of slack workspaces in our slack app.

This is designed to work as a service linked to workspaces that intend to allow their users ge notified with recent messages in a browser extension.

The extension provides a shortcut to the slack workspace(s) and only shows the channels and workspace users need to engage with conversations.
